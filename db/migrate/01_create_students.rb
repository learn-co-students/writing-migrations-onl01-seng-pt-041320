class CreateStudents < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
    #The first thing we will do is create a table. In
    #`db/migrate/01_create_students.rb`, write the code to create a table with
    #Active Record. We've created a class for you called `CreateStudents`.

    #Define a method called `change` and use the Active Record `create_table`
    #method within that method to create the table. The table should have a `:name`
    #column with a type `string`.

    #After you finish defining the `change` method, run the migrations by running
    #`rake db:migrate` in your terminal.
